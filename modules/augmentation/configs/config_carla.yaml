  user_prompt: "Analyze the traffic intersection surveillance footage and generate a detailed description of the visual elements. Focus on: 1) Weather conditions (clear sky with shadows/highlights, overcast with flat lighting, snow falling with accumulation, rain with wet roads and reflections, or fog with reduced visibility), 2) Time of day and lighting conditions (dawn, morning, noon, afternoon, dusk, night), 3) Road conditions (dry, wet, icy, snow-covered) and marking visibility. Use objective, factual language to describe the observable visual details without speculation."

    negative_prompt: |
      The video captures a game playing, with bad crappy graphics and cartoonish frames. It represents a recording of old outdated games. The lighting looks very fake. The textures are very raw and basic. The geometries are very primitive. The images are very pixelated and of poor CG quality. There are many subtitles in the footage. Overall, the video is unrealistic at all.
